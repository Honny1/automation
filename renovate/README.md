# Renovate Presets

Renovate has a ***TON*** of configuration options.  To help prevent sprawl, it
offers a mechanism for centralizing common presets in files that can then be
referenced from other repository deployments.  For more info on renovate,
its configuration options, and presets,
[please RTFM](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/).
